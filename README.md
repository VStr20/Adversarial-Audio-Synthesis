# Adversarial Audio Synthesis

This repository explores adversarial approaches to audio synthesis using GAN-based models. It includes two primary implementations, **PianoGAN** and **SpectoGAN**, designed for generating audio representations such as piano music or spectrogram-based audio synthesis.

## Features
- **PianoGAN**: A GAN model tailored for generating piano music.
- **SpectoGAN**: A GAN model for generating audio through spectrogram representations.
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for model exploration and experimentation.
- Supplementary reports and a demo video showcasing the results.
